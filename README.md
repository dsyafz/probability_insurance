# probability_insurance

This project is using a dataset consisting of individual insurance data with a total of 1338 data rows. 
The Pacmann team provided me with this dataset, which includes the following columns:
age: the age of the insurance customer
sex: the gender of the insurance customer
bmi: the customer's body mass index in kg/m2
children: the number of children covered by insurance
smoker: whether the customer is a smoker or not
region: the geographic region of the customer (northeast, southeast, southwest, or northwest)
charges: the total health bills covered by insurance

I added new column "bmi_category" to define BMI category based on cdc.gov
